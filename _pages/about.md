## The Canadian Indicator Framework for the Sustainable Development Goals

## Canadaâ€™s 2030 Agenda National Strategy is about:
* building an inclusive enabling environment that supports achievement of the SDGs
* leveraging our different strengths and experiences for all of Canada, whether in the Arctic, rural and coastal communities or our large cities
* Canadians doing our part as global citizens
* acknowledging the important commitments to reconciliation and self-determination with Indigenous Peoples
* recognizing commitments to gender equality, a healthy environment, peace, justice and human rights

## Statistics Canada's role for the Canadian Indicator Framework
Statistics Canada is the central focal point for reporting on the progress for the Canadian Indicator Framework indicators. Statistics Canada is responsible for the collection, collation, analysis, presentation and dissemination of data for regular monitoring of progress against the Canadian ambitions and targets.

## About this website
* Statistics Canada has developed this interactive data hub using the <a href="https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Open SDG platform </a> to disseminate the Canadian Indicator Framework data and report on progress towards the Canadian ambitions and targets.

* Statistics Canada is continuing to examine data sources that may be useful for reporting on the indicators and over the coming months will continue to add data, statistics, and data visualization features to enhance the experience of users as well as furthering the dissagregation of data.
