## How do I suggest improvements to the data hub?
If you have feedback on the data hub, please email us at <a href="mailto:{{site.email_contacts.questions}}">{{site.email_contacts.questions}}</a>.

## How often will new data be added to this site?
We will add data as soon as it has been sourced and validated. This includes new data as well as updates to data we have already published. We will continue to incorporate data from existing sources whenever possible.

## What is the relation between the Canadian Indicator Framework and the National strategy?
<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/agenda-2030/moving-forward.html">Canada’s 2030 Agenda National Strategy</a> sets out an approach to accelerate progress towards meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Canada, and contribute to their achievement internationally
As part of that strategy, there are five core objectives in the strategy which include: 
1.	Fostering leadership, governance and policy coherence
2.	Raising awareness, engagement and partnerships
3.	Accountability, transparency, measurement and reporting
4.	Reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples and the 2030 Agenda
5.	Investing in the SDGs 
The Canadian Indicator Framework and the Data hub provides the measurement and reporting necessary to the ensure accountability and transparency in objective 3, required to monitor progress towards the achievement of the 17 Goals and 30 Canadian ambitions.  

## What is the difference between the Canadian Indicator Framework and the Quality of Life Framework?
The goal of the SDGs of “leaving no one behind” is a critical call to action for all nations and peoples that will take the effort and contributions of all levels of governments, civil society and individuals.  In complement to Canada’s 2030 Agenda National Strategy: Moving Forward Together and the Canadian Indicator Framework, Budget 2021 introduced Canada’s new <a href="https://www.budget.gc.ca/2021/report-rapport/anx4-en.html">Quality of Life Framework</a>, designed to better incorporate quality of life measurements including prosperity, health, environment, social cohesion and good governance into the federal government’s budgeting and policy development.  The framework also focuses on how outcomes are distributed across population sub-groups and on ensuring outcomes are sustainable over time.  While the QoL framework is derived from evidence on the determinants of well-being, rather than a specific focus on the SDG goals and the global challenge for a better and more sustainable future for all, the two frameworks ultimately share a common aim: to encourage transformational social, economic and environmental change to achieve increased quality of life and well-being and they are mutually reinforcing. This means the CIF and the Quality of Life Framework share many common indicators. Jointly, they can help shape future conversations about measuring what matters and taking action to improve the lives of Canadians.

## What is the difference between the Canadian Indicator Framework and the Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators program?
<p>The Sustainable Development Goals and the Global and Canadian Indicator Frameworks are designed to provide measures of the three pillars of sustainability – society, the economy and the environment while the Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators (CESI) program provides data and information to track Canada's performance on key environmental sustainability issues including climate change and air quality, water quality and availability, and protecting nature. CESI is the prime instrument to measure progress of the Federal Sustainable Development Strategy and responds to Environment and Climate Change Canada's commitments under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and the Department of the Environment Act to report to Canadians on the state of the environment.
</br>Not surprisingly, several of the environmental indicators in the CIF come from the CESI, as these frameworks are complementary.</p>


## How accessible is this website?
Our aim is to make this website as accessible and usable as possible for every user. We are working towards meeting AA level of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag-20).

## What browsers can I use to view this website?
Our website works with most of the latest versions of the commonly used browsers. There are some issues with using the site on older versions of browsers (such as IE8) and the Open SDG team is working to fix these.

## What does the reporting status mean?
We have used three different types of reporting status for an indicator, which are also colour coded:

* Reported online (black) – as a minimum the headline national data for this indicator is available on this website but the data might not be fully disaggregated yet. We are continuing to source additional disaggregations.
* Statistics in progress (grey) – we have found a suitable source of data for this indicator or relevant proxy at national level. We are currently quality assuring the data and preparing it for publication.
* Exploring data sources (white) – we are still looking for a suitable data source for this indicator.

Where there is additional information about the status of indicator data collection and reporting, this will be displayed at the top of the indicator page.

## Can other countries copy this website?
Yes. This site is built and hosted using 100% free software and services, so other countries and localities can freely and easily reuse our code. Technical guidance on implementing this platform is available [here](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io). Countries and localities exploring how to report their own SDGs data can also get support from the [Center for Open Data Enterprise (CODE)](http://www.opendataenterprise.org/) through their [SDG National Reporting Initiative](https://www.sdgreporting.org/).
